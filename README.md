# About Me

**Software and AI Architect focused on intelligent systems and automation**

I design and build complete, intelligent systems ranging from intuitive frontends to scalable backend infrastructure, AI-powered workflows, and automation pipelines.

## Expertise

- **Languages:** C#/.NET, TypeScript/JavaScript, C++, Rust  
- **Frameworks:** Blazor, React, Node.js  
- **AI/ML:** LLM integration (OpenAI, llama.cpp, custom tooling)  
- **Systems:** Software architecture, embedded systems, smart automation (testing, CI/CD, internal processes)

I focus on blending robust architecture with automation to eliminate bottlenecks, optimize development workflows, and enable adaptive software systems.

## Projects

- **Picotat** – Discord bot hosting platform with plugin management and community tools  
- **Egroo** – Privacy-first, cross-platform messaging platform  
- **llama.grammar** – Lightweight grammar engine for structured LLM output control  
- **AI.FileOrganizer** – AI-powered file and folder organizer with automatic image classification
- **MCP.FileSystem** – Comprehensive Model Context Protocol (MCP) server providing secure file system operations for AI assistants. Built with .NET 8, featuring file/directory management, advanced search capabilities, and Docker support.

## Currently Exploring

- Systems-level programming and concurrency with Rust  
- Enhanced LLM tooling and real-time integration strategies

## Mission

Build systems that think, adapt, and scale.
