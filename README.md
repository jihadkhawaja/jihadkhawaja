# Software Development Specialist  

Iâ€™m a dedicated **C# full-stack developer** with a strong focus on building innovative solutions using **Blazor** and **React (TypeScript)**. My expertise in **C# .NET, ASP.NET Core,** and modern web technologies enables me to craft robust, scalable applications with seamless user experiences.  

I'm also the creator of **[Egroo](https://github.com/JihadKhawaja/Egroo)**, a **privacy-focused messaging** cross-platform application.  

Additionally, I have proficiency in **Python** and hands-on experience with **AI frameworks** and **open-source models** like **Llama** and **OpenAI**, empowering me to integrate intelligent features into my projects.  

I also have knowledge in **C++** and **embedded systems**, allowing me to work on low-level programming and hardware-related projects.  

I'm always eager to try new thingsâ€”**lately, I've been exploring Rust!** ðŸš€
