# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Founder | Software & AI Architect | Automation Engineer

I design and build complete intelligent systems, from intuitive frontends to scalable backend infrastructure, AI-powered workflows, and automation pipelines.

My expertise lies in:

- **Languages:** C#/.NET, JavaScript/TypeScript, C++, Rust
- **Frameworks/Libraries:** Blazor, React, Node.js
- **AI/ML:** LLM integration (OpenAI, llama.cpp, custom tooling)
- **Other:** Strong architectural design, smart automation (testing, CI/CD, internal processes), embedded systems, low-level programming

I focus on blending strong architecture with smart automation, optimizing everything from test generation to internal company processes.

## My Projects:

- **Picotat:** A Discord bot hosting platform with built-in plugin management and community tools
- **Egroo:** A privacy-first, cross-platform messaging platform
- **llama.grammar:** A lightweight, expressive grammar engine for controlling LLM outputs

## Currently Exploring:

I'm actively exploring Rust for its performance and safety benefits.

## My Mission:

Build systems that think, adapt, and scale.
